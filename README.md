AlgoMakan is a premium real estate marketplace built on the Algorand blockchain. It enables users to browse, invest in, and own property collectibles (NFTs) with the security and transparency of decentralized technology.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real Estate NFTs**: Each property is represented as a unique Asset (ASA) on Algorand.
- **Secure Escrow**: Smart contracts manage the exchange of ALGO for NFT assets, ensuring trustless transactions.
- **UI/UX**: A responsive interface designed for real estate presentation.
- **Seamless Wallet Integration**: Supports Algorand wallets like Pera.

## 🛠 Integrating with Smart Contracts

ApnaMakan uses automatically generated TypeScript clients for interacting with the backend. 

- When you compile smart contracts in `makan-contracts`, artifacts are generated.
- `makan-frontend` automatically picks up these artifacts to create TypeSafe application clients.
- Review [`projects/makan-frontend/package.json`](projects/makan-frontend/package.json) for the `generate:app-clients` command.
